/*******************************************************************************

    Request handler helper to delay suspension of a fiber until a suitable time.

    It is common to have multiple fibers in a request handler (managed by a
    RequestEventDispatcher), one of which wants to suspend another, at some
    point. However, it is not possible to suspend a fiber from the outside; the
    suspension must be handled from inside the fiber to be suspended. This
    helper mediates this situation by tracking pending suspension requests and
    allowing the fiber to handle them, suspending itself at an appropriate
    juncture.
