/*******************************************************************************

    Helper struct for node-side suspendable requests which behave as follows:
        * Operate on a single channel.
        * Send a stream of data, broken down into individual messages.
        * The stream can be suspended, resumed, and stopped by the client. These
          actions are known as "state changes".
        * While a state change is in progress, the client is unable to request
          another state change.
        * All state changes are acknowledged by the node by sending a special
          ACK message to the client.

    The struct handles all state change logic and communication with the client.
    Request specifics such as codes and messages sent back and forth between the
    client and node are left deliberately abstract and must be provided by the
    request implementation which uses this helper.
