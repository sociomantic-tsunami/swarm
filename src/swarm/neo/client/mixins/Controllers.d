        as a constructor argument (changeable via a method) and throws, when

    /***************************************************************************

        Class template to provide an `ISuspendable` API for request controllers,
        based on the `Controller` class, above. The request to be controlled
        must implement `suspend()` and `resume()` methods, both expecting no
        arguments.

        Note that, while it implements the standard ISuspendable, this class is
        only a partial match for that interface. The difference lies in the fact
        that suspendable requests only allow a single state-change (i.e. suspend
        or resume) signal to be in flight to the node at any one time. Because
        of this -- and at odds with what ISuspendable normally expects -- a call
        to suspend() or resume() may not immediately take effect. Instead, the
        Suspendable notes that a state-change was requested and carries it out
        when the handlePending() method is called by the user. Thus,
        handlePending() should be called when the user is notified that the
        previous state-change has been completed.

        (In the future, we may adapt the suspendable/throttling code in ocean to
        handle this different case.)
