/*******************************************************************************

    Helper struct for client-side suspendable requests which behave as follows:
        * Operate on all nodes.
        * Receive a stream of data, broken down into individual messages.
        * The stream can be suspended, resumed, and stopped by the user. These
          actions are known as "state changes".
        * While a state change is in progress, the user is unable to request
          another state change.
        * State changes are initiated by the user via a "controller" -- an
          interface to the active request, allowing it to be controlled while in
          progress.

    The struct handles all state change logic and communication with the node
    (on a per-request-on-conn basis). Request specifics such as codes and
    messages sent back and forth between the client and node are left
    deliberately abstract and must be provided by the request implementation
    which uses this helper.

    Each request-on-conn should have an instance of SuspendableRequest. The
    request's shared working data should contain an instance of the nested
    struct SuspendableRequest.SharedWorking.

    A note about the state handling methods:

    As control is sometimes given over to the caller, via the delegates that
    these methods use, it is possible that the user may have the opportunity to
    use the request controller while a method of SuspendableRequest is in
    progress. This possibility is handled, internally, by remembering the
    desired state at the beginning of the method and checking whether it's
    changed.
