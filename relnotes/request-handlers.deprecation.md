## Function to map request code -> info in node's request handler map deprecated

`swarm.neo.node.ConnectionHandler`

The `ConnectionHandler.RequestMap.add` method that sets up a mapping from a
request code to information about the request is now deprecated. Usage should be
replaced with the new overload (see New Features).
