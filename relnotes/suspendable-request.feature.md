* `swarm.neo.client.mixins.SuspendableRequestCore`

  Added helpers encapsulating core behaviour for suspendable, all-nodes
  requests, including an implementation of a request controller that can be
  exposed to the user API and the standard logic for a client-side controller
  fiber in a multi-fiber, suspendable request.
