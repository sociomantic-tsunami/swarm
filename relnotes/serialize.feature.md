### New mixin template to add a `serialize` method to a container

`swarm.neo.client.mixins.SerializeMethod`

This is the counterpart to the template in
`swarm.neo.client.mixins.DeserializeMethod`, and is designed for use with
request notifiers that allow the user to provide a value to the request via a
buffer in the notification union.
